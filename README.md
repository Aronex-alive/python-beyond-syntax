##  #DAY_1 
Today I learned about the history of python. It was created in 1991 by Guido van rossum
along with that I learned about repl which stands for read evaluate print loop. 
After read a simple definition of programming.<br>
THAT IS ALL FOR TODAY <br>

##  #DAY_2 <br>
Today i learned about the different ways in which python can be used for suppose machine learning AI and 
many more.I have also seen a simple program of Javis ,which can perform certain prebuild tasks like
opening youtube, google etc.YOu can check the program as it is attacted in this repo as #DAY_2.py .<br>
Let's meet tomorrow. <br>

##  #DAY_3 <br>
It was a nice day and i learned about modules in python which are basically pre-written code which anyone 
can fetch and use according to his/her use. <br>It is of two types:-<br> 1. Build-in module <br>2. External module<br> python contains some preinstalled modules whic travel with or which are installed with the install of
python on the other hand there are external module which the user has to download from internet before it.
<br>
**Code for installing an external module:**  
```
pip install <module-name>
```
for example :- pip install pandas, pip install sklearn<br>
See you tomorrow<br>

##  #DAY_4 <br>
Today I made my first python programe .which wasn't much but a simple programe that prints some instructions. I used print() function in python:-
``` print("Hello world")
print("I am Aronex"," \n nice to meet you")
```
This is up for today tomorrow I will study escape sequences.<br>

##  #DAY_5 <br>
Hola! world. Today i learned about escape sequence characters in python. It refers to those characters which help us to tll the python that we want a new line or '' or "" to be displayed to the user.
```
print("Hello Word \n my name is Aronex")  # here the \n is a escape sequence character 
```
I also learned about some more functions used within print function that are :-
1.sep<br>
2.end<br>
3.file<br>
The **sep** is used to define that what should be printed between the Statement present within the the print function and **end** is used to specify what should be printed at the end of the print function.
```
print("Have a good day","my friend",sep="-",end="@")
```
Have a great day ahead.<br>

##  #DAY_6  <br>
Hola World! today i learned abuot data types in python and variables. **variables** are basically containers inpython which can store different data types. Ther are two types of data types that is :-<br>
1.**Mutable datatype**<br>
2.**Imutable datatype**<br>
Those datatypes which can be changed are called mutable data types whereas those datatypes which can not be changed are know as imutable datatypes. The mutable data type includes **list ,dictionary and sets** and imutable datatype includes **string , tuple** etc. Following are the few data types in python :-<br>
 **1. String datatype** :- anything enclosed within single or double quotes is a string.
 ```
 a="Hello World"
 print(a)   # here a is a variable which stores the value in it
 print(type(a))  # this type() function is used to find the type of a data entered in python
 ```
**2. Numeric datatype** :- this includes numeric values
```
b=142  
print(type(b))  # here the type will be integer so <class= 'int'> wil be printed
c=123.5
print(type(c))   # here float will be printed
d=complex(4,2)
print(type(d))  # here complex will be printed
```
**3. Sequencial datatype** :- it incles lists,tupleand sets
```
list=[1,2,3,[apple,orange]] 
tuple1=(12,3,34,76) 
dict={ "Name":"Aronex","Class":11}
set={12,54,78,4,5}
```
**4. Boolean datatype** :- it gives otput only in True or False
<br>
so these were the different data types in python. **You can check the DAY_6** program file for more codes( it is present in the save repo).<br>
let's meet tomorrow have a great day.<br>
##  #DAY_7  <br> 
Welcome back friends today i learned about operators in python which are following :-
```
+ #addition
- #subtraction
* #multiplication
/ #division
// #floor division 
% #remainder modulus
** #exponential
```
 and make that you check **My first Python exercise or program #DAY_7.py** for creating a calculator.<br>
 Thah's all for today. Adios Amigos<br>

 ##  #DAY_8   <br>
 Today i have not learned much because today was the solution day of the previous day's exercise but still ther are few **VS Code** stortcuts which i want to tell you guys :-
```
ctrl + / # for making the selected lines a comment
alt + shift + downarrow # for replicating the line 
```
Let's hope for a better tomorrow.Adios<br>

 ##  #DAY_9   <br>
 Welcome again guys, Today I learned what is typecasting in python. It is the procees of changing the type of different data types using function like **int(), hex(), oct(), float() etc.** and type casting is of two types that are :-<br>
 1.Explicit Type casting<br>
 2.Inplicit Type casting<br>
 Explicit type casting is done by the coder or programer which involes use of functions like :-<br>
 **a=34<br>
 print(str(a)+"Hello")**<br>
 And in Implicit type casting the python interpretor Automatically converts the type of a data ex.<br>
 **a=12<br>
 b=1.8<br>
 print(a+b) # here python first converts a into float type after that it adds it**<br>
Following some sample code:-
 ```
 a=31
 b=52
 print(a+b)
 print(str(a)+str(b))  #Here output will be 3152 because a and b is treated as string
 ```
 I also learned about the **type() function**, which tells us the type of data entered.<br>
**Make sure that you Check DAY_9 program for it.**<br>
 Have a great day<br>
