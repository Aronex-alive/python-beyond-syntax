After read a simple definition of programming.<br>
THAT IS ALL FOR TODAY <br>

##  #DAY_2 <br>
Today i learned about the different ways in which python can be used for suppose machine learning AI and 
many more.I have also seen a simple program of Javis ,which can perform certain prebuild tasks like
opening youtube, google etc.YOu can check the program as it is attacted in this repo as #DAY_2.py .<br>
Let's meet tomorrow. <br>

##  #DAY_3 <br>
It was a nice day and i learned about modules in python which are basically pre-written code which anyone 
can fetch and use according to his/her use. <br>It is of two types:-<br> 1. Build-in module <br>2. External module<br> python contains some preinstalled modules whic travel with or which are installed with the install of
python on the other hand there are external module which the user has to download from internet before it.
<br>
**Code for installing an external module:**  
```
pip install <module-name>
```
for example :- pip install pandas, pip install sklearn<br>
See you tomorrow<br>

##  #DAY_4 <br>
Today I made my first python programe .which wasn't much but a simple programe that prints some instructions. I used print() function in python:-
``` print("Hello world")
print("I am Aronex"," \n nice to meet you")
```
This is up for today tomorrow I will study escape sequences.<br>

##  #DAY_5 <br>
Hola! world. Today i learned about escape sequence characters in python. It refers to those characters which help us to tll the python that we want a new line or '' or "" to be displayed to the user.
```
print("Hello Word \n my name is Aronex")  # here the \n is a escape sequence character 
```
I also learned about some more functions used within print function that are :-
1.sep<br>
2.end<br>
3.file<br>
The **sep** is used to define that what should be printed between the Statement present within the the print function and **end** is used to specify what should be printed at the end of the print function.
```
print("Have a good day","my friend",sep="-",end="@")
```
Have a great day ahead.
