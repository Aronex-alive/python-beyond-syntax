It was a nice day and i learned about modules in python which are basically pre-written code which anyone 
can fetch and use according to his/her use. <br>It is of two types:-<br> 1. Build-in module <br>2. External module<br> python contains some preinstalled modules whic travel with or which are installed with the install of
python on the other hand there are external module which the user has to download from internet before it.
